2 Methods:

1. Unpaired Method
	a. Patch on many cells.
	b. Record the input resistance, using the delay and/or time after to measure the resting voltage.
	c. Record the spikeforms for a couple input currents.
	d. Break seal with current cell.
	e. Put in propofol.
	f. Repeat a. through c.

2. Paired Method
	a. Patch on cell.
	b. Record the input resistance, using the delay and/or time after to measure the resting voltage.
	c. Record the spikeforms for a couple input currents.
	d. Put in propofol without breaking seal.
	e. Repeat b. and c.
	f. Repeat a. through e. for many cells.

Input Resistance Protocol (Do not bring the cell to -60 mV):
Delay = 2 sec
Starting Current = -55 pA
Finishing Current = 20 pA
Increments = 20
Pulse Duration = 1 sec
Pause Duration = 1 sec
Record Length = 44 sec

Spikeform Protocol (Bring cell to -60 mV):
Delay = 10 sec
Starting Current = 90 pA
Finishing Current = 100 pA
Increments = 2
Pulse Duration = 50 sec
Pause Duration = 20 sec
Record Length = 160 sec


Protocol for time experiments:
1. Patch on a cell
2. Run resting_potential protocol:
    -2 sec delay
    -0 pA starting and ending currents
    -1 increment
    -2 sec pulse duration
    -5 sec pause duration
    -10 sec total time
3. Run input_resistance protocol:
    -2 sec delay
    --55 pA to 20 pA
    -20 increments
    -1 sec pulse
    -1 sec pause
    -44 sec total time
4. Run fi_curves protocol:
    -2 sec delay
    -10 pA to 150 pA
    -10 increments
    -5 sec pulse
    -10 sec pause
    -145 sec total time
